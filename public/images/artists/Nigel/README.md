# Nigel Artist Folder

## How to Add Artist Photos:

1. **Profile Photo**: Drag your cropped artist photo here and rename it to `profile.jpg`
   - Should be square (1:1 ratio)
   - Minimum 300x300px
   - Will be displayed as a circular profile image

2. **Additional Images**: You can also store other images related to this artist here:
   - `profile.jpg` (main profile photo - required)
   - `artwork1.jpg`, `artwork2.jpg`, etc. (additional artworks)
   - `process.jpg` (work-in-progress shots)
   - `studio.jpg` (studio photos)

## Current Status:
- ❌ Profile photo needed: `profile.jpg`
- ⏳ Artist page needs to be activated (I can help with this!)

## File Path Reference:
This folder corresponds to: `/src/pages/artist_pages/Nigel.astro`

          <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
            This fabric portrait was created by <strong>Gary V. Lett</strong>, Instructor, Anthologist, and CEO of Lett's Do Art, 
            hailing from Pomona, California. Gary's artistic journey began when he sketched his first self-portrait in front of 
            their living room mirror before entering kindergarten. Growing up near the Pomona Fairgrounds, the roar of dragster 
            engines ignited his imagination into a passion for drawing racing vehicles, popping wheelies and all.

          <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-top: 1rem;">
            As a visual artist, Gary refuses to confine himself to a single genre. Over the years, he's developed into a 
            multifaceted creator, working through various mediums including paint, drawing, sculpture, ceramics, fabric, and 
            graphic art. His sixth-grade teacher, Mrs. Fredericks, played a pivotal role in channeling his artistry and motivated 
            him to stretch his creative and academic abilities through storytelling and illustrating.

          <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-top: 1rem;">
            Despite facing race-based rejection in the late 1970s due to Black life themes in his paintings, Gary's creative 
            pursuits endured. His artistic narratives define a confluence of history, community, and a search for purpose, 
            emphasizing the significance of enriching lives through love and appreciation of diverse histories and heritages.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
          Malcolm X (1925-1965) was a powerful African American Muslim minister and human rights activist who was a prominent 
          figure during the civil rights movement. A spokesman for the Nation of Islam until 1964, he advocated for Black 
          empowerment and the promotion of Islam within the Black community. Malcolm X's speeches and writings emphasized 
          racial pride, economic self-reliance, and identity politics, making him an enduring symbol of Black resistance 
          and self-determination.

        <h2 style="color: #ffa500;">About the Artwork</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
          As the instructor of the textile art class, Gary had no intentions of making a portrait himself. However, when a 
          participant abandoned the Malcolm X portrait after laying down the jacket, shirt, and tie, Gary picked it up and 
          brought it to its zenith. This piece represents not only Gary's technical mastery across diverse mediums but also 
          his commitment to completing meaningful work that honors civil rights icons.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-top: 1rem;">
          The Malcolm X portrait stands as part of Gary's broader artistic mission: creating works that depict civil rights 
          leaders and emphasize the ongoing struggle for equality and justice. Gary is currently creating a mural depicting 
          Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights icons with a voting theme, to be installed in Pomona.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
          This fabric portrait was created by <strong>Sundai Clark</strong>, a 16-year-old artist from Pomona, California, 
          and 11th grader at Claremont High School. Sundai participated in the Sirius Young Scholar program at 
          The African American Museum of Beginnings (TAAMB), where she was surrounded by rich African American history and culture.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-top: 1rem;">
          This textile work represents Sundai's first experience with fabric art. She is also learning American Sign Language 
          (pursuing ASL 3) with career aspirations in the field, and enjoys singing, sewing, drawing, writing, video games, 
          and musical theater. She has performed in 8 theatrical shows and dreams of writing and illustrating a children's book.

      <h2 style="color: #ffa500;">About the Artwork</h2>
      <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
        This fabric portrait required careful consideration of light and shadows to make the artwork "pop," with Sundai 
        spending considerable time choosing, adjusting, and rearranging fabrics to achieve the desired effect. Her favorite 
        part of the process was selecting the various fabrics, noting that her final choices differed significantly from 
        her initial selections.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-top: 1rem;">
        The background fabric attached behind Angela Davis's head became the most interesting element of the composition. 
        Sundai was inspired by Angela Davis's fearlessness, activism, and strength during her fight against injustices. 
        She hopes to meet Angela Davis one day and show her this tribute artwork, expressing admiration for Davis as an 
        empowering role model and strong fighter for justice.

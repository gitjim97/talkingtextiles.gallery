          <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
            This fabric portrait was created by <strong>Lisha K. Lett</strong>, affectionately known as "Queen Lisha" by her husband, 
            Gary Lett. Elder Artist and Secretary of Lett's Do Art, Inc., Lisha is the proud soulmate of Gary for 46 years of marriage. 
            Together they have two dynamic sons—Vincent, the musician, and Victor, the visual artist—and eight vibrant, intelligent, 
            talented, and loving grandchildren.

          <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-top: 1rem;">
            Taking the Improvisational fabric portraiture art class with Gary was a life-changing experience for Lisha. Although she 
            and Gary had made a fabric portrait of her mother before this class, she never considered herself an artist. When people 
            asked if she was an artist, she always replied, "No!" But now her response is "Yes!" She's created two fabric portrait 
            artworks and exhibited them publicly, along with Gary's and Victor's art.

            Her work was featured in February 2023 at the African American Advisory Alliance (4A's) in Pomona, California, and in 
            February 2024 at the Ontario International Airport Administration office. The 4A's show, titled "It's a Lett Art Thang," 
            was curated by Gary with their son Victor as the headliner. At the show, Lisha was interviewed for the University of 
            La Verne College newspaper, explaining her art process.

        <h2 style="color: #ffa500;">About the Subject</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
          Rev. Charles H. Lett, Sr. was Gary Lett's father, a man whose legacy lives on through this powerful textile portrait. 
          As a reverend, he represented faith, family values, and the spiritual foundation that continues to influence the Lett 
          family's artistic and community work. This portrait serves as both a tribute to family heritage and a celebration of 
          the strength and wisdom passed down through generations.

        <h2 style="color: #ffa500;">About the Artwork</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
          This masterful fabric portrait of Rev. Charles H. Lett, Sr. represents Lisha's creative breakthrough. The class, held at 
          The African American Museum of Beginnings (TAAMB) from December 2022 through November 2023, was where her creativity 
          reached a higher level. She is thrilled to now be considered a budding fine artist.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-top: 1rem;">
          It was a tremendous honor for Lisha to have her artwork in the same art show as her husband Gary and son Victor. Having 
          her husband and soulmate as her class instructor was incredible, though she intentionally tried not to be the teacher's 
          pet, willingly sharing him with the other students. She is so proud of her finished product—a masterful work of art 
          honoring her father-in-law and preserving his legacy through fabric and thread.

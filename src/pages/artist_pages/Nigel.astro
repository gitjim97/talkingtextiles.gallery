          <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
            Robert Hicks is an upcoming senior at the University of California, Merced, pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering. His journey into this field stems from a lifelong passion for cars that began in childhood. He's particularly proud of the Chevy Camaro he built himself and has bought and sold cars for profit as a side venture.
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
            In high school, Robert took honors and AP classes while playing varsity football as a defensive back/strong safety and competing in varsity track and field, specializing in the 100 meters. He was actively involved in clubs such as Leaders Making Leaders and the Black Student Union, experiences that shaped his leadership skills and community involvement.
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
            At UC Merced, Robert's collegiate involvement includes The National Society of Black Engineers, Associated Students Representative (student government), Black Student Coalition, and Sigma Chi fraternity. Known for his energetic and talkative nature and lively spirit, whether in the garage working on his car or out with friends, he strives to be the life of the party, making every moment memorable.

        <h2 style="color: #ffa500;">About the Subject</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
          Dr. Cheikh Anta Diop was a pioneering Senegalese historian, anthropologist, physicist, and politician who studied the human race's origins and pre-colonial African culture. His work challenged Eurocentric views of African history and emphasized the contributions of African civilizations, particularly ancient Egypt's African origins. Robert delved into Dr. Diop's life and contributions during his summer 2023 experience at TAAMB, gaining a deep appreciation for his groundbreaking work.

        <h2 style="color: #ffa500;">About the Artwork</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
          One of the most enriching and enjoyable experiences of Robert's summer 2023 was attending TAAMB (The African American Museum of Beginnings), where he learned about the history of Africans and African Americans and participated in creating fabric art. Although Robert felt his artwork "wasn't the best," the process was gratifying and enjoyable.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
          This portrait of Dr. Cheikh Anta Diop represents Robert's journey into African history and textile art—a creative departure from his mechanical engineering studies and automotive passions. The work honors Dr. Diop's legacy while demonstrating how art can bridge disciplines, connecting a future engineer with the rich cultural heritage that Dr. Diop devoted his life to documenting and celebrating.

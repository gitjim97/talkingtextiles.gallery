          <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
            <strong>Jeannetta Hunter</strong> was born to Shirley and Ora Roberson in San Francisco, CA, on March 22, 1955, where she 
            attended school and completed her education. She chose herself as the subject for this portrait, reasoning that if she 
            didn't do the portrait justice, she wouldn't hurt anyone else. This self-portrait represents both artist and subject in 
            one powerful expression of identity.
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-top: 1rem;">
            Jeannetta carries a profound historical legacy: she is the great-great-great-great-great-granddaughter of President James 
            Madison, the 4th President of the United States. Her lineage traces back to an African woman named Mandy, who was born 
            free in Ghana, stolen from her homeland, and sold to James Madison, Sr. Mandy gave birth to Corrine, and the family line 
            continued through Jim, Emanuel, Giles Madison (Jeannetta's maternal great-grandfather), and Chester Madison (her grandfather). 
            Many of her ancestors are buried at Montpelier, where President Madison lived as a child, and where her heritage runs deep 
            through documentation.
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-top: 1rem;">
            While always interested in the arts, Jeannetta discovered her true passion for quilting in 2016 when she became a senior. 
            Her maternal grandmother, Georgia Madison, was a quilter, so "it's in my blood," she says, hoping to continue the legacy. 
            Before 2016, she didn't even know how to thread a sewing machine! Once she caught the bug, she was hooked. In her own words, 
            quilting is her "zen, my peace, my happy place."

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
          This self-portrait represents Jeannetta's journey into improvisational fabric portraiture under the instruction of renowned 
          artist Mr. Gary Lett. It has been an honor and privilege for her to work with Gary, learning techniques she now shares with 
          a new generation of young artists. The process has allowed her to meet many talented seniors and youth who share the same 
          desires and passion for the arts.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-top: 1rem;">
          Jeannetta believes strongly in preserving this art form: "We can't allow the art to die. Our community needs this art form 
          to help share our story of a rich culture." She hopes this art continues to inspire and develop young people, who will pass 
          it on to the next generation, thereby enriching the culture. This self-portrait stands as testament to her commitment—a woman 
          carrying the legacy of both her quilter grandmother and her complex American heritage, using fabric and thread to tell her 
          own story and inspire others.

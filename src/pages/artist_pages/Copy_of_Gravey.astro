        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
          This fabric portrait was created by <strong>Khalif Rasshan</strong>, Elder Artist and CEO of The African American Museum of Beginnings (TAAMB). 
          Born John Gordon in 1951, Khalif is a retired history teacher with 37 years in education, earning degrees from La Verne College (BA Sociology) 
          and Azusa Pacific College (MA Education).

        <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-top: 1rem;">
          In 2011, Khalif co-founded TAAMB with his wife Victoria, transforming a three-month Black History exhibit into a regional museum reflecting 
          African diaspora and African American history. He has received numerous awards including the 2018 Lifetime Achievement Award and founded 
          multiple educational programs including Sirius Young Scholars, Academic Progress Through Chess, and youth mentoring initiatives.

      <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
        Marcus Moziah Garvey (1887-1940) was a Jamaican political activist, publisher, journalist, and orator who became a powerful advocate 
        for Black nationalism and Pan-Africanism. He founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and was a proponent of Black pride, 
        economic independence, and the Back-to-Africa movement.

      <h2 style="color: #ffa500;">About the Artwork</h2>
      <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff;">
        As a student of African diaspora history, Khalif chose Marcus Garvey as his subject because he sees many Garveian traits within himself, 
        particularly Garvey's drive for "self-repair: The healing of the Black Mind first!" Khalif believes in Garvey's philosophy that as a people, 
        we must have a clear understanding of who we are - "a people of royalty" - before we can improve our environment and circumstances.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #fff; margin-top: 1rem;">
        This textile portrait represents the intersection of Khalif's passion for African American history education and his artistic expression, 
        honoring a leader whose vision for Black empowerment and self-determination continues to inspire educators and activists today.
